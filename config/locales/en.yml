# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        AWS access and secret key is required to construct Chef & Zabbix Server and to enable SkyHopper to manage your infrastructures.
        If you have no AWS Securty credentials yet, please follow this link:
        <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html" target="_blank"> Managing Access Keys for your AWS Account </a>.
      aws_region: |
        After setting the security credentails please select the aws region for SkyHopper instances to be deployed.
        The purpose for this is to reduce data latency in the application.
      aws_keypair: |
        To allow SkyHopper to access your instance, you must create a key pair, specify the name of the key pair when you launch the instance.
        In this case, if you have already a KeyPair you can select 'Use Existing KeyPair' and select or drag the file into the drop box.
        However, you can also create a new KeyPair Using the entered AWS Security Credentials you entered and by selecting 'Create a New KeyPair' option.
